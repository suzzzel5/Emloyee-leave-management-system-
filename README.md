Employee Leave Management System is a Vibe Code based web application built to manage employee leave processes inside an organization. The project focuses on fast and functional development using a simple workflow. The system supports two roles, admin and employee. Admin handles employee onboarding and leave approvals. Employees manage leave requests through a personal dashboard.

Admin registers employee details during company onboarding. Registered employees receive login access to the system. After login, employees view a personal dashboard. Employees submit leave requests for five days or less with a clear reason. Admin views all submitted leave requests in detail. Admin approves or rejects requests based on the validity of the reason. The system updates leave status for employee visibility.

All application data stores in a MySQL database. The database uses structured tables for admin, employee, and leave records. Proper relationships link employee accounts with leave requests. This structure keeps records organized and consistent.

The project uses a standard web technology stack. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend manages business logic and database communication. The development follows a Vibe Coding approach with focus on speed, clarity, and working features.

This project replaces manual leave tracking with a digital solution. It improves efficiency and transparency in leave management. It suits academic projects and small organizational use.
